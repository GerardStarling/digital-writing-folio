### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

I mainly work within short fiction and free verse poetry, focusing on my locality

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write

I mainly poetry in a book or in the notes section of my phone. It is then transferred over to word or google docs. for fiction I combine writing in a book or straight into a word processor.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write of facilitate your writing)?

By writing in a book by hand, I have time to process the sentence as it is constructed, and think about the line that will follow. using a processor to write is a lot faster, but I find myself blocked a lot faster.
