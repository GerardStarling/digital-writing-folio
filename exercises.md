### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

I mainly work within short fiction and free verse poetry, focusing on my locality

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write

I mainly poetry in a book or in the notes section of my phone. It is then transferred over to word or google docs. for fiction I combine writing in a book or straight into a word processor.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write of facilitate your writing)?

By writing in a book by hand, I have time to process the sentence as it is constructed, and think about the line that will follow. using a processor to write is a lot faster, but I find myself blocked a lot faster.


## Week 2

- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
Electronic literature is not restricted by page margins or static text. as software and hardware is everchanging, the works can be temporal. Electronic literature seems to be self published alot of the time, so it is not adhering to literary trends or kept beyond the firewall of publishing houses as much as print based lit is.

- What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 
As mentioned before, some of the main qualities is that the works are not confined to physical page boundaries. Margins can be infinite, and texts can travel in any form desired.
