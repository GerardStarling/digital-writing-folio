### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

I mainly work within short fiction and free verse poetry, focusing on my locality

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write

I mainly poetry in a book or in the notes section of my phone. It is then transferred over to word or google docs. for fiction I combine writing in a book or straight into a word processor.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write of facilitate your writing)?

By writing in a book by hand, I have time to process the sentence as it is constructed, and think about the line that will follow. using a processor to write is a lot faster, but I find myself blocked a lot faster.


## Week 2

 #### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

Electronic literature is not restricted by page margins or static text. As software and hardware is everchanging, the works can be temporal. Electronic literature seems to be self published alot of the time, so it is not adhering to literary trends or kept beyond the firewall of publishing houses, as much as print based lit is.

 #### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

As mentioned before, electronic works are not confined to physical page boundaries. texts can ascend from the conventions of left to right (of the english language), and travel in any direction. It can also exist in many different visual forms.


#### Taroko Gorge Remix Exercise - Flourish Klink version

#### - What aspects of the remix are the same?

The speed of the text transitions appear to be the same. The text itself appears to share the same source

#### - What aspects of the remix are different?

The background colours are different. The bright orange background of the Flourish Klink version is alot harsher and harder to focus on.

#### - Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

the colour green of the background was one of the main techniques used to symbolise the natural setting of Taroko Gorge. Replacing this colour with orange may be trying to symbolise Taroko Gorge at sunset, but makes it very hard to engage with, as the colour is so intense. I don't think this version captures or enhances the original intent of Nick Montfort's original
